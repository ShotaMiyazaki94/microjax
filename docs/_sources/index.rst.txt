Welcome to microJAX's documentation!
====================================

``microJAX`` is an auto-differentiable microlensing toolkit built on top of
JAX. The library provides point-source and finite-source magnification models,
fast contour integration, and utilities for trajectory generation and
inference-ready likelihoods.

Use this documentation as a companion to the project README: the guide sections
walk through installation and common workflows, while the API reference links
to detailed, auto-generated documentation for the public modules.

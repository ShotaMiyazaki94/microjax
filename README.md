**microJAX** is a **fully‚Äëdifferentiable**, **GPU‚Äëaccelerated** software for modelling gravitational microlensing light curves produced by **binary**, and **triple** lens systems, using the **image-centered ray shooting (ICRS)** method [(e.g., Bennett 2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716.1408B/abstract). Written entirely in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), it delivers millisecond‚Äëlevel evaluations of extended-source magnifications *and* exact gradients for every model parameter through the use of [automatic differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html), enabling gradient‚Äëbased Bayesian inference workflows such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference.

This software is under active development and not yet feature complete.

## üì¶ Installation

From PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip install microjaxx
```

Notes:

- PyPI package name: `microjaxx`
- Python import name: `microjax`

```python
import microjax
```

Development install (from source):

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShotaMiyazaki94/microjax.git
cd microjax
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

GPU support: JAX/JAXLIB with CUDA/ROCm depends on your environment. Please follow the official JAX installation guide to install the appropriate `jaxlib` for your accelerator:

- JAX installation (CPU/GPU): https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Tip: for numerical robustness we recommend enabling 64-bit in JAX:

```python
import jax
jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

Compute an extended-source binary-lens magnification light curve using the image-centered ray shooting (ICRS) method with a hexadecapole fallback:

Note: `mag_binary` also works on CPU but is very slow; a GPU-enabled JAX runtime (CUDA/ROCm) is strongly recommended.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from microjax.inverse_ray.lightcurve import mag_binary
jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

# Binary-lens parameters
s, q = 1.0, 0.01            # separation and mass ratio (m2/m1)
rho = 0.02                  # source radius (Einstein units)
tE, u0 = 30.0, 0.0          # Einstein time [days], impact parameter
alpha = jnp.deg2rad(10.0)  # trajectory angle
t0 = 0.0

N_points = 1000
t = t0 + jnp.linspace(-2*tE, 2*tE, N_points)
tau = (t - t0)/tE
y1 = -u0*jnp.sin(alpha) + tau*jnp.cos(alpha)
y2 =  u0*jnp.cos(alpha) + tau*jnp.sin(alpha)
w_points = jnp.array(y1 + y2 * 1j, dtype=complex)

# Extended-source magnification (binary lens)
mu = mag_binary(w_points, rho, s=s, q=q)
```

For point-source magnification, use:

Note: `mag_point_source` runs on CPU (and GPU), so it works without a GPU.

```python
from microjax.point_source import mag_point_source
mu_point = mag_point_source(w, nlenses=2, s=s, q=q)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Triple-lens hexadecapole/ghost-image test is not yet implemented: triple-lens calculations fall back to full contour integration everywhere, which can be substantially slower.
- GPU tests are opt-in and currently targeted at NVIDIA A100. Without an A100 (or `MICROJAX_GPU_TESTS=1`), GPU-marked tests are skipped.
- For improved numerical stability and agreement across libraries, enable 64-bit precision in JAX (`jax_enable_x64=True`).

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!  Please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for coding style, test suite, and CI guidelines.  Bug reports can be filed via GitHub¬†Issues.

### Running Tests

CPU-only tests:

```
pytest -q
```

GPU-only (A100) tests are opt-in and skipped by default. To run them on an A100 machine:

```
export MICROJAX_GPU_TESTS=1
pytest -m gpu -q
```

These tests require JAX to detect an NVIDIA A100 (CUDA) device. If not available or the env var is not set, they are skipped.

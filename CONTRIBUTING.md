# How to contribute to ExoJAX

## Branch model and pull-request (PR)
We adopt a simple git-flow model, consisting of master, develop, contributor-defined, and release branches. PR by contributors via a folked repository is always welcome.

- master: stable branch. Once a set of functions is implemented in the **develop** branch, the maintainer (@ShotaMiyazaki94) will merge them to the master branch through the release process (release branch).

- develop: default branch for developers. PR by contributors will be merged to this branch, after the review process.

- contributor-defined branches: The contirbutors make their own branch originated from the develop branch and after developing, we send a PR to the develop branch. The branch name is like the followings: feature/hminus_opacity, bugfix/hminus, etc.

- release: we make the release branch prior to a new version release. The contributors are expected to review the release branch.
